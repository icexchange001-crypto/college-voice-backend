# WayFinder.Ai Navigation System - Multi-Institution Platform

## Overview
WayFinder.Ai is a multi-institution AI navigation platform providing voice-powered AI assistants, real-time mapping, and intelligent pathfinding for various institutions like colleges, hospitals, and courts. It aims to offer a scalable solution for institutional navigation with a world-class professional design, building on the foundation of a college management system. The platform's ambition is to solve navigation chaos with intelligent, accessible guidance, making complex institutions easily navigable for everyone.

## User Preferences
I want the AI to ask before making major changes and to prefer detailed explanations. Do not make changes to the folder `Z` or the file `Y`. I prefer an iterative development approach.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform features a professional, futuristic AI-themed landing page with neon glows, glassmorphism effects, and smooth animations. Admin panels are designed with professional dashboards, gradient-styled statistics, and real-time sync indicators. The AI Assistant interface supports both voice and text input, offering clear conversation flows and text-to-speech responses. The design system leverages Radix UI and Tailwind CSS for consistent and modern UI components across all interfaces.

**Court Admin Panel** (`/court-admin`): Professional purple gradient-themed admin panel for Kaithal District Court with 6 sections - Dashboard, Courtrooms, Buildings, Staff Directory, Files Tracking, and Building Images. Features include comprehensive CRUD operations, building image upload with metadata (title, description, room number, building name, department, contact person), and stats dashboard displaying total courtrooms, buildings, staff members, and active files.

### Technical Implementations
The frontend is built with React 18 and TypeScript, using Wouter for routing and TanStack Query for state management. Voice input is handled via the Web Speech API. The backend utilizes Express.js with TypeScript for API services, supported by a custom in-memory session manager for AI and token-based authentication. Supabase (PostgreSQL) serves as the primary database, employing Realtime subscriptions for instant data synchronization. AI capabilities are powered by OpenAI GPT-4 (Court Assistant) and Groq API Llama-3.3-70B (Campus AI), integrating data from both static JSON and live Supabase sources with intelligent intent classification. The system implements secure login for administrators and departments, provides real-time updates via Supabase Realtime, and is fully mobile-friendly.

**Court-Specific Features**: Three-tier TTS system (OpenAI → Cartesia → Browser fallback), intelligent query analyzer detecting location/navigation questions with keyword extraction, building images feature displaying relevant court location photos with metadata when users ask "where is X?" or "show me the registry office", and comprehensive admin panel for managing all court data with graceful error handling in database-unavailable scenarios.

### System Design Choices
The architecture is a three-tier model ensuring clear separation of concerns and access levels. It incorporates event-driven real-time updates through Supabase Realtime. The AI uses a hybrid data source approach, combining static JSON with dynamic Supabase data for comprehensive information. A 3-layer AI-powered hybrid layer model handles query processing, focusing on intent classification, smart source prioritization, and cross-verification for high accuracy.

## Recent Updates

### November 10, 2025
- **Court Image Display & UX Enhancement**: Improved building image presentation with full-screen modal and compact chat layout
  - Fixed image cropping issue by changing from `object-cover` to `object-contain` with white padding - now shows complete images without cutting
  - Reduced chat image size (h-28 sm:h-32) for compact chat area while maintaining clarity
  - Implemented click-to-expand modal: images are small in chat, clicking opens full-screen modal with dark overlay, close button, and smooth animations
  - Modal features: max-h-[80vh] object-contain sizing, backdrop dismissal, AnimatePresence transitions
  - Updated all building responses to conversational Hinglish format instead of direct listings
  - Example: "Civil Block me aapko courtrooms, judge chambers aur legal aid cell milenge. Hearing ke liye aap Room 21 ya Room 22 me ja sakte hain..." (friendly and helpful vs robotic listing)
- **Court Building Image + Room & Service Lookup System**: Implemented static data-driven navigation system for instant deterministic responses without LLM latency
  - Created `server/court-static-data.ts` with BUILDINGS (civil, record, filing), ROOMS (15 mapped rooms), and SERVICES (30+ Hinglish keywords) data structures
  - Added static lookup in `/api/court/ask` that preempts LLM call when service keywords, room numbers, or building names are detected
  - Supports queries like "Mujhe certified copy leni hai" → instant response with Room 14 (Record Section) + building image
  - Uploaded 3 building images to `client/public/images/court/` (civil_block.png, record_section.png, filing_section.png)
  - System returns structured JSON with `buildingImages` array containing id, title, description, image_url, room_number, building_name
  - Maintains full backward compatibility - non-matching queries still flow through Supabase + AI-powered responses
- **Court TTS Text Normalization Enhancement**: Implemented comprehensive text normalization for Court Voice Assistant to properly read times, phone numbers, and email addresses - matching college voice assistant functionality
  - Added `normalizeEmails()` function with letter-by-letter domain spelling: "kaithalcourt@gov.in" → "kaithalcourt at the rate g, o, v dot i, n"
  - Enhanced phone number normalization to handle both international format (+91-1746-234567 → "plus nine one, one seven four six, two three four five six seven") and plain 10-digit Indian mobile numbers (9876543210 → "nine eight seven six five, four three two one zero")
  - Applied `normalizeTextForTTS()` in both Court TTS endpoints (ElevenLabs `/api/court/tts` and OpenAI `/api/court/tts-openai`) for consistent pronunciation
  - Added debug logging to preview normalized text in console for monitoring
  - Normalization pipeline: custom pronunciations → URLs → emails → phone numbers → years → times → ordinals → acronyms → general numbers
- **Court Response Formatting Overhaul**: Eliminated all markdown and complex formatting from voice responses for clean, natural TTS
  - Updated system prompt with critical formatting rules: "NEVER use ANY markdown formatting: no **, ***, *, __, [], (), etc."
  - Provided explicit correct/wrong format examples in system prompt to guide AI responses
  - Enhanced text cleaning function in both TTS endpoints to strip ALL markdown: triple asterisks (***), double asterisks (**), single asterisks (*), underscores (__, _), markdown links [text](url), standalone URLs in parentheses
  - Added comprehensive emoji removal for cleaner speech output
  - Result: Responses go from "**Email:** kaithalcourt@gov.in" to clean "Email: kaithalcourt@gov.in" for perfect TTS pronunciation
- **Court TTS Optimization**: Removed chunking system for continuous natural speech like normal assistants - text now processed in single ElevenLabs API call for smooth playback
- **Character Limit Protection**: Added 4500 character safety limit with intelligent sentence-boundary truncation to prevent ElevenLabs API failures on long responses
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implemented specific error messages for common TTS failures (413 text too long, 401/403 authentication, 429 rate limit) with detailed logging
- **ElevenLabs Settings Update**: Voice changed to "3AMU7jXQuQa3oRvRqUmb" with optimized parameters (stability: 0.55, similarity_boost: 0.7, style: 0.4) for better Hinglish pronunciation
- **Platform Rebranding**: Complete rebranding from "Re-Act" to "WayFinder.Ai" across all user-facing pages, documentation, and footer - maintaining consistent brand identity
