Mini-admin permissions: only CRUD within their scope (e.g., add rooms in their building, edit FAQs for their dept, view tickets for their scope).

Notes:

Mini-panel users login to a mini interface (limited UI): add/edit rooms under their building, update staff for that dept, add FAQs for their area.

Main admin can revoke access anytime.

8) Content Management / FAQs (Head-editable)

Purpose: Quick Q&A and announcements that assistant can use.

Features:

Add/Edit/Delete FAQ entries (Question, Answer, Category)

Categories: Timings, Documents, Directions (textual), Procedures, Announcements

Option: Mark FAQ as Head-only editable (only designated heads or mini-admins can add)

Announcements: pinned messages that assistant can read out (with expiry date)

Usage: Assistant first checks FAQ for quick answers before calling external sources.

9) Tickets & Unanswered Queries (Logs)

Forms: validate required fields; friendly error messages

Protect sensitive actions (view/regenerate mini credentials) with main admin password prompt

Mobile-friendly basic layout for mini-admins

Use consistent tone: Hindi UI labels + English placeholders (as you prefer)

13) Data Flow Summary (how assistant uses admin data)

Assistant first checks FAQ / Procedures for direct answers.

For location queries, assistant checks Buildings → Rooms → Staff data.

If info is missing, assistant creates a ticket automatically (visible in Tickets).

Mini-admins can immediately fix missing data in their scope so future answers succeed.
