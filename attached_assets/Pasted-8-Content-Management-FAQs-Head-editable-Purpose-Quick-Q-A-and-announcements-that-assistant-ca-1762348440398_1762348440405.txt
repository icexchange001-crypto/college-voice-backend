Categories: Timings, Documents, Directions (textual), Procedures, Announcements

Option: Mark FAQ as Head-only editable (only designated heads or mini-admins can add)

Announcements: pinned messages that assistant can read out (with expiry date)

Usage: Assistant first checks FAQ for quick answers before calling external sources.

9) Tickets & Unanswered Queries (Logs)

Purpose: जहाँ वो queries जाएँ जो assistant ने नहीं सुलझाईं।

Ticket fields:

Question text

Timestamp

Source (web / voice)

Status (Pending / In Review / Resolved)

Assigned to (main admin or mini-admin)

Notes / Resolution

Admin can convert a ticket into:

FAQ entry

Room/Staff addition (i.e., update DB)

Mark resolved with note

(Full analytics/dashboard charts can be added later)

11) Settings & Logout

Settings includes:

Main admin change password

System language default (Hindi/English)

TTS configuration (voice on/off, prefer OpenAI TTS or browser)

Backup / Export DB (basic)

Feature toggles (enable/disable mini-admin creation)

Logout: main logout. Mini-admins have logout on their mini panel.

12) UI / UX Notes (Simple & Practical)

Clean sidebar with sections: Dashboard / General Info / Buildings / Rooms / Departments / Mini-Admins / FAQs / Tickets / Logs / Settings / Logout

Forms: validate required fields; friendly error messages

Protect sensitive actions (view/regenerate mini credentials) with main admin password prompt

Mobile-friendly basic layout for mini-admins

Use consistent tone: Hindi UI labels + English placeholders (as you prefer)

13) Data Flow Summary (how assistant uses admin data)

Assistant first checks FAQ / Procedures for direct answers.

For location queries, assistant checks Buildings → Rooms → Staff data.

If info is missing, assistant creates a ticket automatically (visible in Tickets).

Mini-admins can immediately fix missing data in their scope so future answers succeed.

14) Acceptance Criteria (how to mark this done)

Main admin can add Building and Room (room must be linked to a Building).

Main admin can create Mini-Admin; system generates link + credentials; viewing these requires re-entering main admin password.

Mini-admin can login to mini-panel and add/edit rooms within their assigned scope.

FAQ entries can be added/edited and used by assistant for replies.

Unanswered user queries are saved to Tickets with proper fields and can be resolved by admin.

Settings allows toggling TTS and changing admin password.

Logout works and mini-admin links are revoke-able.

15) Security Notes (quick)

Keep admin auth server-side, use hashed passwords.

regenerating/viewing mini credentials must require re-authentication.

Rate-limit ticket creation to avoid spam.

Backup periodically.
