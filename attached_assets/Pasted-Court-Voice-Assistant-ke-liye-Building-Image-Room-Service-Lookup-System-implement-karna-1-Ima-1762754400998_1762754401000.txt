Court Voice Assistant ke liye Building Image + Room & Service Lookup System implement karna.

1) Image Setup (Static, No Mapping API Required)

Images location:

public/images/court/


Add these 3 building highlight images:

File Name	Display Name	Purpose Description
civil_block.png	Civil Block	Courtrooms, judge chamber, legal aid
record_section.png	Record / Copy Section	Case records & certified copy section
filing_section.png	Filing & Registration Section	New case filing & application submission

Note:
Images me sirf building highlight hogi, rooms image me draw nahi honge.

2) Data Structure (Code me define karna hai)
Buildings Data
const BUILDINGS = {
  civil: {
    name: "Civil Block",
    image: "/images/court/civil_block.png",
    description: "Is building me courtrooms, judge chambers aur legal aid cell hota hai."
  },
  record: {
    name: "Record / Copy Section",
    image: "/images/court/record_section.png",
    description: "Yahan case records aur certified copy issue hoti hai."
  },
  filing: {
    name: "Filing & Registration Section",
    image: "/images/court/filing_section.png",
    description: "Yahan naye case ki filing, application submission aur stamp/token ka kaam hota hai."
  }
};

3) Room Mapping (Important Logic)
Civil Block Rooms
Room No	Purpose
Room 21	Civil Courtroom - Hearing
Room 22	Civil Courtroom - Hearing
Room 23	Judge Chamber
Room 24	Waiting / Witness Seating Area
Room 25	Legal Aid Cell (Free Legal Help)
Record / Copy Section Rooms
Room No	Purpose
Room 11	Old Case Record Storage
Room 12	Record Index Search Desk
Room 13	Copy Form Submission Counter
Room 14	Certified Copy Issue Counter
Room 15	Secured Record Vault
Filing & Registration Section Rooms
Room No	Purpose
Room 31	Filing Clerk Office
Room 32	Case Filing / Application Submission
Room 33	Affidavit Verification Desk
Room 34	Token & Queue Number Issue Counter
Room 35	Stamp & Payment Desk
Room Data Object
const ROOMS = {
  21: { building: "civil", purpose: "Civil Courtroom (Hearing)" },
  22: { building: "civil", purpose: "Civil Courtroom (Hearing)" },
  23: { building: "civil", purpose: "Judge Chamber" },
  24: { building: "civil", purpose: "Waiting / Witness Area" },
  25: { building: "civil", purpose: "Legal Aid Cell (Free Legal Help)" },

  11: { building: "record", purpose: "Old Case Record Storage" },
  12: { building: "record", purpose: "Record Index Search Desk" },
  13: { building: "record", purpose: "Copy Form Submission Counter" },
  14: { building: "record", purpose: "Certified Copy Issue Counter" },
  15: { building: "record", purpose: "Record Vault" },

  31: { building: "filing", purpose: "Filing Clerk Office" },
  32: { building: "filing", purpose: "Case Filing / Application Submission" },
  33: { building: "filing", purpose: "Affidavit Verification Desk" },
  34: { building: "filing", purpose: "Token Issue Counter" },
  35: { building: "filing", purpose: "Stamp / Payment Desk" }
};

4) Service → Room Mapping (User Query → Room Identify)
const SERVICES = {
  "file submit": 32,
  "file jama": 32,
  "case file": 32,
  "application": 32,
  
  "certified copy": 14,
  "copy": 14,
  "case copy": 14,
  
  "legal aid": 25,
  "free legal help": 25,
  "mujhe vakil chahiye": 25,
  
  "judge se milna": 23,
  "hearing": 21
};

5) Response Logic Flow
User Query
↓
Check SERVICES for keyword → If match → room number → ROOMS[room].building
↓
Else: check if query contains room number → direct ROOMS lookup
↓
Else: check if query contains building name → BUILDINGS lookup
↓
Return:
{
  text: "explanation…",
  image: BUILDINGS[building].image,
  spoken: final voice line
}

6) Example Behavior
User:

“Mujhe certified copy leni hai.”

System:

SERVICE match → certified copy → Room 14

ROOMS[14] → building = record

BUILDINGS[record].image → show record_section.png

Voice:

“Certified copy Record Section ke Room 14 me milti hai.”

✅ Expected UI Output
[ record_section.png ]
Record / Copy Section
Room 14: Certified Copy Issue Counter


Voice speaks same.
