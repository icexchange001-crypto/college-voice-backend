✅ Project Brief: Re-Act AI Navigation System

We currently have a working AI assistant and admin panel designed for a college environment.
The assistant can answer student queries about class location, departments, and related institutional information.

✅ Goal Now

We are extending this system into a full, advanced multi-institution platform:

College

Hospital

Court

Each institution will have:

Its own voice assistant page

Its own demo data

Its own mini-admin panel

A different navigation experience          we alrady have college system fully working with assistant , panel etc just need it to connect to landing page and other court and hospital assistant we need to made all of them 

✅ Primary Focus Feature

For court (and later very large universities) we need an advanced indoor + outdoor AI navigation demo:

System should identify building and room based on query
Example: “Room 25 kaha hai?”

AI returns navigation steps like:

“Gate 1 se enter karein”

“50 meter straight”

“Right side Building A”

“First floor, room 25”

On screen:

Google Map/embedded map

Highlight court boundary

Path line animation

Building marker (custom overlay)

Popup building photo

Text + voice guidance

We do not use QR system right now.
Navigation logic will be demo-based, with manual mapping data added in backend.

✅ Demo scope

Only one court for now (example: Kaithal Court)

We will manually:

Highlight court area on map

Mark Gate-1

Mark one building

Assign rooms to that building

Later we will scale this system.

✅ UI & Flow

Landing page with:

Re-Act explanation

Problem & vision

Features

Buttons for 3 demos: College / Hospital / Court

When user clicks:

Load respective assistant

For court assistant, show map + voice path instructions + building photo popup + glowing path

✅ Tech Notes

Google Maps embed

Custom map overlay markers (manual for demo)

All data for buildings/rooms will be stored in our admin panel

Voice assistant will fetch from backend and guide user

🎯 Your first task

Build the Landing Page first.
After landing page, we will start connecting dynamic demos & mapping logic.

Landing page must include:
