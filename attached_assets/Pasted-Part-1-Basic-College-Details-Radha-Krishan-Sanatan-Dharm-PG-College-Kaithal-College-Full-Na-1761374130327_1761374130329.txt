Inspired by community leaders and led by Seth Makhan Lal, the idea of founding a college took shape. The Rashtriya Vidya Samiti (Regd.), Kaithal, was officially registered in 1954 under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860.
1954 — Establishment of RKSD College:
The college was founded as an Intermediate College in a rented building and named after Seth Makhan Lal’s father-in-law, Shri Radha Krishan Ji. Later, it shifted to its current campus spread over 10 acres on the Ambala–Hisar Highway.
1976 — Attaining Post-Graduate Status:
RKSD College achieved PG status with the introduction of M.A. (Hindi). Subsequently, it expanded into multiple disciplines, adding M.A. (Political Science, English), M.Sc. (Mathematics), BBA, and BCA programmes.
2003 — Introduction of Evening Session:
To accommodate more students, the Government of Haryana and Kurukshetra University permitted the college to begin Evening Session classes.
2017 — NAAC Accreditation:
The college was accredited with an ‘A’ Grade by NAAC, affirming its commitment to academic excellence, quality assurance, and institutional growth.
Ongoing Development:
