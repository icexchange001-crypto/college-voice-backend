Overview (short)
RKSD College runs multiple student support structures — Career Guidance & Counseling Cell, Grievance Redressal Cell, Anti-Ragging Committee, Women Cell / Internal Complaints Committee (ICC), SC/ST / Minority Cell, Placement Cell, Alumni Association, plus extension units like NSS / NCC — all aimed at student welfare, protection and employability. 
1) Career Guidance & Counseling Cell
Purpose: Career planning, pre-placement training, soft-skills workshops, one-to-one counselling and employer connects.
Activities: Workshops, panel discussions, placement drives (e.g., collaboration with NIIT for Axis Bank drive, May 31, 2025), mock interviews, resume clinics and campus recruitment facilitation. 
How students apply: Attend notices issued on college website/noticeboard or approach the Career Cell office during working hours. College maintains a record of placement events on its “Placement” tag. 
2) Placement Cell
Role: Liaisons with industry, organises placement drives, skill-development tie-ups and tracks placement outcomes.
Recent activity / metrics: Campus placement drives recorded (local employers, banks); historical placement rate data on public portals shows modest placement activity — some reports list placement rate ≈20% and packages in local ranges (example portal data). For authoritative figures always use Placement Cell’s yearly report. 
3) Grievance Redressal Cell
Mandate: Address student complaints (academic, infrastructure, harassment, financial) through an institutional grievance policy; grievances are to be submitted to the Principal/Cell and addressed per the policy timeline. Process and policy document available on college website. 
4) Anti-Ragging Committee & Anti-Ragging Squad
Mandate: Ensure ragging-free campus in line with UGC regulations. Committee members and convener names are published in staff committees documents. Complaints are handled immediately and per UGC norms. 
5) Women Cell / Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) & Gender Sensitization
Mandate: Prevent and redress sexual harassment; gender-sensitivity programs; women’s empowerment activities. ICC / Women Cell constituted and documented in Gender Audit and related files. Students can approach ICC / Women Cell as per the internal complaint mechanism.
